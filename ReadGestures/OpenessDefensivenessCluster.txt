Openess: Seated individuals unbutton their coats, uncross their legs, and move up toward the edge of the chair and closer to the desk or table that separates them from their opposer. Communicates a possible agreement, solution, or generally a positive expression of working together for the needs of both.
Defensiveness: Arms crossed on chest. This gesture can affect the rest of the group. Notice when the person first crossed his arms: after an offer, a request, or a demand was made. Agreement becomes more difficult. Fists confirm the position.
Leg over arm of chair: The person is not cooperative. Usually unconcerned about or hostile to the other person's feelings or needs. Could announce dominance or territorial rights.
Straddling chair/ Sitting other side of chair: Occur during superior/subordinate situations.
